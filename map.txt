Pacman|https://lolghuiy4tgfyu4th7tvtg.github.io/gamey/arcade/pacman.swf|swf|Arcade|None|One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to\nclear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.\n\nPac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful ("Inky"), the trailing red ghost Shadow ("Blinky"),\nthe fast pink ghost Speedy ("Pinky"), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey ("Clyde"). One touch from any of these ghosts means loss of a life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating one of the four Power-Pills located around the maze.\nDuring this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time as the ghosts' eyes\nfloat back to their center box and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions starring Pac-Man and the ghosts.

When so many other Flash games needed lightning-quick reflexes\nand complex problem solving, Don't Shoot the Puppy looked like it needed those things too, but if you did anything you lost.\n\nThousands of comments proved how hard it was for people to think of inaction as a strategy, and still more fell for the later levels (which somehow tricked people when all the\nones before were solved without touching anything).From fake popup ads to fake blank screens to fake obstacles, players convinced themselves\nthat this time the puppy needed help, but what we didn't realize was how many people could not just sit and watch for 10 minutes.\nEven though we sit through movies or TV for hours\non end, Flash games are so ADD-friendly that many people lost patience and knowingly killed the dog.
